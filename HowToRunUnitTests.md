# Introduction #

Amazon-CXF contains several JUnit test cases that can be used as examples on how to use the library. However some steps need to be followed before trying to run them.


# Details #

Since you need a username/password in order to call the Amazon Web Services it wasn't possible to include them in the repository.

You can create your own AWS account by visiting http://aws.amazon.com/

## Changes to you local Maven Settings ##

Add the following to your HOME/.m2/settings.xml right before ` </settings> ` and replace the appropriate values. If you don't use a proxy then leave cxf.proxy as just <cxf.proxy></cxf.proxy>.

See the [Signing Requests](SigningRequests.md) page for information on keystore.alias and keystore.password
